## HTML basics
Have Visual Studio Code downloaded (I chose the stable version). 

Create a folder (e.g. called 'HTML') on your computer (i did in my portable harddrive). 

Open VS Code, under 'Explorer' tab, click 'open folder' and choose your new folder 'HTML'. 

Click 'New File', and type its name as 'Index.html', which is usually used as the home page of a website. 
In this file, type `<`, can see available codes - just click Return(Enter), get 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
where html is not case-sensitive - but we often type everything in lowercase except `DOCTYPE`.
