## Head section
In a black .html file (I created boilerplate.html for this), type `!` and click Tab, we will get a boilerplate html file, that is a basic template. 
Check out the items it uses:
- lang
- `charset` character set, it uses UTF-8, it is a character set like ASCII but it contains almost all characters in the world's languages
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />` it resizes the viewport part (the visible part) of the webpage (which can be resized by resizing the browser in practice) to fit with all computer monitors

can also add:
- keyword
- description

So the boilerplate looks like: 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta name='keywords' content='HTML, CSS'>
    <meta name='description' content='...'>
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

## Text

`em`, Emphasize, which is by default using _italic_ to stress the enclosed content
- can change the style of `em` in the `style` section

## Entities
